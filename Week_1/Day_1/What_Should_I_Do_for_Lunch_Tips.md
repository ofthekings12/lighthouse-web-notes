### Tips

Try experimenting with the comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `===`, etc.) in the node REPL, which you can launch using the `node` command in Vagrant.

Work on your code iteratively â€“ that means in small pieces. 

To help you figure out how to use `hungry` and `availableTime` inside your function, try outputting their values to the Terminal as follows.

```javascript
function whatToDoForLunch(hungry, availableTime) {
  if (hungry === true) {
    if (availableTime < 20) {
      console.log("Pick something up and eat in lab!");
    } else if (availableTime === 20 || availableTime < 30) {
      console.log("Try somewhere nearby!");
    } else if (availableTime > 30) {
      console.log("It's bootcamp... use your time wisely.");
    }
  } else {
    console.log("Get back to work!");
  }
  return whatToDoForLunch;
}
```
